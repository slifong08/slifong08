Hi, my name is Sarah Fong.

I am a post-doc in the department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences at UCSF

My interests include functional genomics, genome evolution, human genetics, machine learning, hematopoiesis, and immunology. 

These repos reflect different projects from my postdoc at UCSF and my Ph.D. in Human Genetics, Vanderbilt University.

For questions or shared interests, contact me at slifong08.at.gmaildotcom
