Hi, my name is Sarah Fong.

I am a post-doc in the department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences at UCSF

My interests include functional genomics, comparative genome evolution, human genetics, machine learning, hematopoiesis, and immunology. 

These repos reflect different projects from my Ph.D. in Human Genetics, Vanderbilt University.
